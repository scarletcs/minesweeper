# Minesweeper ðŸ’£

This is a straightforward minesweeper game made in React and Electron.

I'm making it as a programming exercise to explore a few things, make myself more comfortable and try out some concepts:

- React state management using context, reducers and actions.
- Electron inter-process communication. (Not yet anything for this.)

## Development

- `yarn build` for a prod build
- `yarn build:dev` for a dev build
- `yarn watch` to run & watch files
